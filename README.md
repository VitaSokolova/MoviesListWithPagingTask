# SearchWithPaginationTask

Repository with a one screen application, showing how to use Flows + Paging 3 + Compose for displaying pageable search results.

Composables are covered with UI tests. There are not so many unit tests, because, unfortunately, Google doesn't provide many opportunities to test PagingData (it is blackboxed).
